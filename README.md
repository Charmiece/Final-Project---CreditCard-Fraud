# Final-Project---CreditCard-Fraud

## Overview 
Using Python and Machine learning, we plan to detect credit card fraud. As eCommerce sales rise, payment fraud continues to plague customers and merchants. We all have been targeted or known someone whose been targeted. It'll be interesting to know how the companies detect when this happens. Also to try and see how credit card companies detect fraudulent websites.
Online fraud has widespread business impacts and requires an effective end-to-end strategy to prevent account takeover (ATO), deter new account fraud, and stop suspicious payment transactions.

## Data Sources
creditcard.csv from Kaggle
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation.
A cohesive toolset that includes bot detection, machine learning models, and behavior analytics that leverage Device ID and telemetry can help security and risk-management leaders detect fraud and prevent policy abuse while minimizing false positives, preserving customer experience, and ensuring successful promotional, reseller, and loyalty programs.

## Analysis

## Communication Protocals 
* Use Slack to ask any questions or concerns regarding the project. 
* Let other members know if there is any scheduling conflict. 
* Let other members know what changes you made and go over them to make sure they are correct. 
* Work on the project on Monday and Wednesday together during or before class over zoom.
* Meet again during the office hours to finish and review segment.   

## Summary

## Questions they hope to answer with the data
1. When should the credit card companies shut off a card when it detects fraud?
