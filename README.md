# Final-Project---CreditCard-Fraud

## Overview 
Using Python and Machine learning, we plan to detect credit card fraud. As eCommerce sales rise, payment fraud continues to plague customers and merchants. We all have been targeted or known someone whose been targeted. It'll be interesting to know how the companies detect when this happens. Also to try and see how credit card companies detect fraudulent websites.
Online fraud has widespread business impacts and requires an effective end-to-end strategy to prevent account takeover (ATO), deter new account fraud, and stop suspicious payment transactions.

## Data Sources
* fraudTest.csv
* fraudTrain.csv
* https://www.kaggle.com/code/chethanbr86/credit-card-fraud-capstone/data
* This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.
This was generated using Sparkov Data Generation | Github tool created by Brandon Harris. This simulation was run for the duration - 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Dec 2020. The files were combined and converted into a standard format.

## Communication Protocals 
* Use Slack to ask any questions or concerns regarding the project. 
* Let other members know if there is any scheduling conflict. 
* Let other members know what changes you made and go over them to make sure they are correct. 
* Work on the project on Monday and Wednesday together during or before class over zoom.
* Meet again during the office hours to finish and review segment.   
 

## Questions they hope to answer with the data
1. When should the credit card companies shut off a card when it detects fraud?
2. What we are trying to accomplish through this data?
3. Which age group are targeted by credit card fraud?
4. Are women targeted more than man?
5. What locations frauds occur?
6. What areas do the company need to pay attention to in order to catch the detection?
7. What machine learning works the best?

## Analysis
The analysis begain researching credit card data sets. Kaggle provided a comprehensive data set that provided merchant locations, date of birth and gender of card members. The data was stored in a S3 bucket on AWS because the data was large. Jupyter notebook was used to clean data. The clean data csv was loaded into Google Colab to perform multiple machine learning models.

An ERD was created from QuickDBD to assist in creating tables in the PgAdmin database. We were successful in connecting the tables through the ETL process from Colab to PgAdmin, however we werent able to run our machine learning models through the database.

### Machine Learning Models
For machine learning our plan was to use unsupervised machine learning. However, since the data already included fraud information, we decided to use supervised learning instead. The clean data was loaded in using AWS S3 bucket. We took smaller samples of the dataset to run the machine learning models because the code would crash using the larger dataset. We used pd.get_dummies in order to include the columns that weren't intergers in our machine learning models. We then split the data to test and train.

#### Logistic Regression
We used logistic regression model with various different types of preprocessing. We trained the data using Random Oversampling, SMOTE Oversampling, Undersampling, and Combination (Over and Under) Sampling.

Logistic regression model analyzes the available data, and when presented with a new sample, mathematically determines its probability of belonging to a class. If the probability is above a certain cutoff point, the sample is assigned to that class. If the probability is less than the cutoff point, the sample is assigned to the other class.

The advantages are:
* Simple algorithm to implement
* Efficient
* Easy to update data

The disadvantages are:
* Can lead to overfitting with high dimensional datasets
* Non linear information cannot be solved.

##### Random Oversampling
* The accuracy score was 87%. It matched with SMOTE and undersampling. 
* It was a good model to run.
* Connfusion Matrix:

#### Balanced Random Forest Classifier
Random Forest algorithm will sample the data and build several smaller, simpler decision trees.

The advantages are:
* Are robust against overfitting as all of those weak learners are trained on different pieces of the data.
* Can be used to rank the importance of input variables in a natural way.
* Can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion.
* Are robust to outliers and nonlinear data.
* Run efficiently on large datasets.

The disadvantages are:
* Creates a lot of trees and more computational power and resources are needed.
* Longer training period

Our results:
* The accuracy score was 100%.

## Summary
Our goal was to find a machine learning model that helped detect when credit card companies should shut off credit cards due to fraudulent activity. We use Balance Random Forest Classifier which gave us a 50% accuracy. This was not a good model due to the data showing less than 1% of the transactions being fraud. The second model we used was Logistic Regression. We preformed SMOTE, Combination (SMOTEEN), Undersampling and Random Oversampler. Logistic Regression with SMOTE preprocessing was our most accurate model. However, even with a smaller sample we took to run the model is fraud prediction was way higher at 8% compared to actual is fraud in the actual dataset at 0.58%. Logistic Regression would not be a good model for credit card fraud detection.

From the analysis, ages 40 to 70 were the most targeted for fraud. Based on the number of transactions, men were targeted more than women for fraud. According to our dataset, more fraud transactions occured on the east coast versus the west coast. The areas that credit card companies should focus on are grocery stores and online shopping.
